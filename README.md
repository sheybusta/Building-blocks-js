### Conditionals 

- The code needs to make decisions and carry out actions accordingly depending on different inputs. 
- Conditional statements allow us to represent such decision making in JavaScript, from the choice that must be made (for example, "one cookie or two"), to the resulting outcome of those choices (perhaps the outcome of "ate one cookie" might be "still felt hungry",...)
